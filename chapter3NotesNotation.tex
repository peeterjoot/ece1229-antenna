Some notes on notation for this chapter and the coverage of this material in class:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Phasor frequency terms are written as \( e^{j \omega t} \), not \( e^{-j \omega t} \), as done in physics.  I didn't recall that this was always the case in physics, and wouldn't have assumed it.  This is the case in both \citep{jackson1975cew:simpleRadiating} and \citep{griffiths1999introduction:waves}.  The latter however, also uses \( \cos(\omega t - k r) \) for spherical waves possibly implying an alternate phasor sign convention in that content, so I'd be wary about trusting any absolute ``engineering'' vs. physics sign convention without checking carefully.

\item In Green's functions \( G(\Br, \Br') \), \( \Br \) is the point of observation, and \( \Br' \) is the point in the convolution integration space.
\item Both \( \BM \) and \( \BJ_m \) are used for magnetic current sources in the class notes.
